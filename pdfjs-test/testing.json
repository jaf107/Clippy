  "Real-world software development involves large sourcecode repositories",
  "Reading and trying to understand otherpeople’s code in such repositories is a difficult and unpleas-ant process for many software developers, especially whenthe code is not sufficiently commented",
  "For example, if theJava method in Fig",
  "1 does not have the comment in the be-ginning, it will take the programmer quite some efforts tograsp the meaning of the code",
  "However, with a meaning-ful sentence such as “calculates dot product of two points”as a descriptive comment, programmer’s productivity can betremendously improved",
  "Figure source code exampleA related scenario happens when one wants to search fora piece of code with a specific functionality or meaning",
  "[",
  "] Table 1 shows thenumber of methods in ten actively developed Java reposito-ries from Github, and those of which annotated with a de-scriptive comment",
  "On average, only 15",
  "4% of the methodsare commented",
  "To automatically generate descriptive comments fromsource code, one needs a way of accurately representing thesemantics of code blocks",
  "One potential solution is to treateach code block as a document and represent it by a topicdistribution using models such as LDA (Blei, Ng, and Jor-dan 2003)",
  "[",
  "] For example,the comment generated by McBurney’s model for Fig",
  "[",
  "] Recursive NN has previously been applied toparse trees of natural language sentences, such as the ex-ample of two sentences in Fig",
  "[",
  "] We then use a Recurrent Neu-ral Network to learn to generate meaningful comments",
  "In this section, we introduce the details of how to repre-sent source code and how to use the representation vectorof source code to generate comments",
  "We propose a new kind of recursive neural network calledCode-RNN to encapsulate the critical structural informa-tion of the source code",
  "Code-RNN is an arbitrary tree formwhile other recursive neural nets used in NLP are typicallybinary trees",
  "3 shows an example of Code-RNN for asmall piece of Java code",
  "In Code-RNN, every parse tree of a program is encodedinto a neural network, where the structure of the networkis exactly the parse tree itself and each syntactic node inthe parse tree is represented by a vector representation",
  "One unique internal node “CombineName” indicates a com-pound identifier that is the concatenation of several primi-tive words, for example, “allFound” can be split into “all”and “found”",
  "More on the semantics of identifier will be dis-cussed later in this section",
  "There are two models for the Code-RNN, namelySumModelandAverage Model:1",
  "[",
  "] However, one challenge toutilize the code block representation vector in Recurrent NNis that we can not feed the code block representation vectorto the Recurrent NN cell directly",
  "[",
  "] Thenwe feed code block vector into the RNN (Recurrent NeuralNetwork) model at every step",
  "4, we in-put the START token as the initial input of model and feedthe code block vector into the hidden layer",
  "Our evaluation comes in two parts",
  "In the first part, we eval-uate Code-RNN model’s ability to classify different sourcecode blocks intokknown categories",
  "In the second part, weshow the effectiveness of our comment generation modelby comparing with several state-of-the-art approaches inboth quantitative and qualitative assessments",
  "The sourcecode of our approach as well as all data set is available athttps://adapt",
  "seiee",
  "sjtu",
  "edu",
  "cn/CodeComment/",
  "Data SetThe goal is to classify a given Java method (weonly use the body block without name and parameters) intoa predefined set of classes depending on its functionality",
  "Our data set comes from the Google Code Jam contest(2008∼2016), which there are multiple problems, each as-sociated with a number of correct solutions contributed byprogrammers",
  "Each solution is a Java method",
  "The set ofsolutions for the same problem are considered to functionidentically and belong to the same class in this work",
  "Weuse the solutions (10,724 methods) of 6 problems as trainingset and the solutions (30 methods) of the other 6 problemsas the test set",
  "[",
  "] For one project, we separate the commentedmethods into three parts: training set, validation set and testset",
  "Mining of source code repositories becomes increasinglypopular in recent years",
  "Existing work in source code min-ing include code search, clone detection, software evolution,models of software development processes, bug localization,software bug prediction, code summarization and so on",
  "Ourwork can be categorized as code summarization and com-ment generation",
  "Sridhara et al",
  "(Sridhara et al",
  "2010) proposed an au-tomatic comment generator that identifies the content forthe summary and generates natural language text that sum-marizes the methods overall actions based on some tem-plates",
  "(Moreno et al",
  "2013) also proposed atemplate based method but it is used on summarizing Javaclasses",
  "[",
  "] (Rodeghero et al",
  "2014) presented an eye-tracking studyof programmers during source code summarization, a toolfor selecting keywords based on the findings of the eye-tracking study",
  "These models are invariably based on templates and care-ful selection of fragments of the input source code",
  "[",
  "] Like source code summarization, Allamanis etal",
  "(Allamanis et al",
  "2015) proposed a continuous embed-ding model to suggest accurate method and class names",
  "Iyer et al",
  "[",
  "] Iyer et al",
  "’s workhas strong performance on two tasks, code summarizationand code retrieval",
  "This work is very similar to our work, inthat we both use the Recurrent NN to generate sentencesfor source code",
  "[",
  "] (Kuhn, Ducasse, andG ́ırba 2007) utilized the information of identifier names andcomments to mine topic of source code repositories",
  "[",
  "] Rollins and Wing (Rollins andWing 1991) proposed an approach to find code with the sig-natures present in code",
  "[",
  "] (Garcia-Contreras, Morales, and Hermenegildo 2016) fo-cused on querying for semantic characteristics of code andproposed a new approach which combines semantic charac-teristics and keyword matching",
  "Cai(Cai2016)proposedamethodforcodeparal-lelization through sequential code search",
  "That methodcanalsobeusedforclonedetection",
  "WilliamsandHollingsworth(WilliamsandHollingsworth2005)de-scribed a method to use the source code change history ofa software project to drive and help to refine the searchfor bugs",
  "[",
  "] The method proposed in this papercan also benefit natural language search for code fragments",
  "In this paper we introduce a new Recursive Neural Net-work calledCode-RNNto extract the topic or function ofthe source code",
  "This new Recursive Neural Network is theparse tree of the source code and we go through all the treefrom leaf nodes to root node to get the final representationvector",

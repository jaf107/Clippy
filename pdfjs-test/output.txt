ABSTRACT

In this paper we present a methodology to analyze users‚Äô con-
cerns and perspectives about privacy at scale. We leverage NLP
techniques to process millions of mobile app reviews and extract
privacy concerns. Our methodology is composed of a binary clas-
sifier that distinguishes between privacy and non-privacy related
reviews. We use clustering to gather reviews that discuss similar
privacy concerns, and employ summarization metrics to extract
representative reviews to summarize each cluster. We apply our
methods on 287M reviews for about 2M apps across the 29 cate-
gories in Google Play to identify top privacy pain points in mobile
apps. We identified approximately 440K privacy related reviews.
We find that privacy related reviews occur in all 29 categories, with
some issues arising across numerous app categories and other issues
only surfacing in a small set of app categories. We show empirical
evidence that confirms dominant privacy themes ‚Äì concerns about
apps requesting unnecessary permissions, collection of personal
information, frustration with privacy controls, tracking and the sell-
ing of personal data. As far as we know, this is the first large scale
analysis to confirm these findings based on hundreds of thousands
of user inputs. We also observe some unexpected findings such
as users warning each other not to install an app due to privacy
issues, users uninstalling apps due to privacy reasons, as well as
positive reviews that reward developers for privacy friendly apps.
Finally we discuss the implications of our method and findings for
developers and app stores.

INTRODUCTION

In app stores, such as Google Play and Apple‚Äôs App Store, users
can write reviews to share their experience and opinions about the
apps that they use. Reviews help other users to understand whether
or not the app might be of interest to them. These reviews are also
a feedback channel to developers who can learn how to improve
their apps. App reviews can be a challenge to analyze as they are
known to cover a broad range of topics, have widely varying quality
(that is somewhat exacerbated by their unstructured form) [
54
 
];
thus it can be difficult for developers to parse out separate issues.
Moreover, some issues, such as privacy related feedback, may have
lower volume than other issues (e.g., battery performance), and thus
may be less visible. However extracting privacy related feedback
is of particular importance as by now developers are well aware
that trust is heavily impacted by their privacy posture, and because
privacy legislation and regulation are on the rise.
Unstructured app reviews provide a potentially rich source of
content to learn about users‚Äô perspectives on privacy. User feedback
can be mined at scale to extract product requirements [
 
45
,
 
68
 
], how-
ever these methods do not focus on privacy. Traditional methods
for gaining insights into user perspectives about privacy include
conducting qualitative studies and surveys. Qualitative studies have
the advantage of being in depth as they involve one-on-one inter-
views, however they are
 
limited in scale
 
to include typically 20-30
participants. Surveys, on the other hand, have the advantage being
structured and repeatable, however are also limited in terms of
scale typically to a few thousands. By leveraging automation and
advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, feedback
by millions of users can be analyzed rapidly to extract privacy per-
spectives. This approach complements existing qualitative methods
as it obtains privacy concerns on a new scale, yet cannot follow up
with users for additional information. Our approach enables data
driven decisions to be made - such as priority ranking across multi-
ple issues. We therefore answer the following research questions:

‚Ä¢
 
Can mobile app reviews be automatically analyzed at scale
to identify privacy related ones?

‚Ä¢
 
Can the identified privacy reviews be used to understand
users‚Äô privacy concerns? How do they compare with con-
cerns inferred from other qualitative methodologies?

‚Ä¢
 
How can such a methodology be leveraged to inform the
ecosystem, and more specifically mobile app developers?
This paper presents two main contributions. The first is a method-
ology to analyze user‚Äôs privacy concerns with mobile apps via NLP

techniques
 
at scale
. The methodology includes a binary classifier
to decide whether or not a particular review discusses a privacy
topic, a mechanism to cluster reviews that discuss similar semantic
topics, and a way to summarize the clusters by identifying reviews
that are highly representative of all those belonging to a single
cluster. Our methodology opens the door to a rich set of subsequent
research on user privacy perspectives (e.g., relative ranking of pri-
vacy concerns, how these concerns evolve over time, why some
privacy issues occur predominantly within specific app categories,
user perspectives on different elements of personal data, etc). It also
enables tools for developers to receive feedback that can help them
improve the privacy of their products.
Our second contribution uses the methodology to provide
 
em-
pirical evidence
 
(a first large-scale analysis) that confirms domi-
nant privacy themes that have been identified in qualitative stud-
ies [
 
3
,
 
25
 
,
 
36
 
,
 
47
,
 
79
 
]. We apply our methods to 287M reviews, and
report on the wide variation of privacy reviews across app cate-
gories, relative reviewing of specific app permissions and dominant
privacy themes. We also discuss the implications of our findings
for developers and how they can inform the design of privacy tools
in app stores.
There are many challenges to this problem space. First, there
is no labeled data. Second, the boundary of when a text is about
privacy or not is a fuzzy one; for example, many security and privacy
experts often do not agree on the amount of overlap between these
two areas [
 
13
,
 
19
]. Third, we need to be able to capture a broad range
of privacy concerns, i.e., any topic that exists in established privacy
taxonomies [
 
4
 
,
 
67
 
]. Fourth, to learn a broad range of contexts, we
need a classifier that can do more than memorization of keywords.
Fifth, user reviews are well known to be variable in their writing
style [
54
 
] which can lead to classification errors. We address all
these challenges herein.
Our first contribution develops a multi-step method to address
this problem. To generate our test, validation and training data we
employ a method that combines Expert-Hand-Labeling and Heuris-
tic Supervision [
 
61
] (Challenge #1). In this bootstrapping process
we construct a set of regular expressions in consultation with lin-
guistic experts, and based on our manual observations of how users
express privacy concerns in reviews (Challenge #2, #3). We next
develop a privacy classifier as an ensemble model that couples both
USE [
 
14
 
] and BERT [
20
 
] deep learning models, which are trained
on user texts and are known to generalize well (Challenge #3, #4,
#5). Our classifier achieves 98% precision and 87% recall. We use
K-means clustering to group similar privacy reviews, and propose
a new metric to determine a good value of
 
ùëò
 
that produces compact
single-issue clusters (Challenge #3). We summarize the topic clus-
ters, by extracting representative reviews for the cluster. Overall
this yields a new method to understand user insights about privacy
that complements traditional qualitative methods.
The development of automated privacy text classifiers (for user
text) and the ability to separate privacy issues into distinct clusters
in an unsupervised fashion, enables numerous types of large-scale
analyses including (some of which are discussed in this paper) -
ranking of issues, breadth of concerns across app types, unantici-
pated and emerging issues, sentiment with which users approach
specific issues, user behavior (e.g. uninstalling an app), compar-
isons across app types (e.g. children‚Äôs versus regular apps), issues
per culture (as captured by language) and more. We discuss how
such findings can inform developers about privacy shortcomings
of their apps, and more generally, how it could inform privacy best
practices across app stores.
Our second contribution is a large scale analysis using our method-
ology on 287M reviews, coming from approximately 2M apps from
the Play Store. We identify approximately 440K reviews that discuss
privacy. We found that the privacy-related reviews exist in all of
the 29 app categories
1
 
in the Play store, and that these reviews
capture a breadth of privacy concerns and perspectives. We find
many reviews where users ask to know the purpose for a request to
collect personal information or permission gated data (e.g., location,
contacts, camera, etc). We observed four somewhat unexpected find-
ings: (1) users warn each other not to install an app due to privacy
reasons; (2) users uninstall apps due to privacy concerns; (3) users
concerns about the selling of personal data are largely confined to
a small set of app categories; and (4) some users reward developers
whose apps are privacy friendly with privacy positive reviews.
We apply our clustering and summarization to ten categories
of apps and identify the large compact clusters within each cat-
egory. From these, we identity five dominant privacy concerns
across multiple app categories: apps that appear to request unnec-
essary permissions, collection of personal information, tracking,
privacy controls and apps that may be selling personal data. Next,
we present an overview of these dominant themes using our au-
tomatically selected representative reviews that summarize each
cluster. While the dominant privacy themes that emerged from our
analysis are generally well-known, we demonstrate the ability to
automate and scale this process. Our initial findings illustrate the
potential of such automated analysis. We conclude the paper with
a discussion on implications for developers and app stores, limita-
tions, and a summary of remaining challenges needed to further
mature this type of analysis.

RELATED WORK

The primary use of NLP in the privacy space in the last few years
has been to analyze privacy policies [

]. Numerous efforts have focused on identifying incon-
sistencies between an application‚Äôs source code and its privacy
policy [

]. Other uses
include developing privacy chat bots [
 
32
] and automated question-
answer systems based on deep-learning techniques [
31
,
 
63
 
] to help
users understand data practices. In [
 
49
 
], the authors explore the use
of NLP to help users avoid inadvertently sharing personally identi-
fying information in social media, emails, and text messages. In [
57
 
]
the authors used NLP to analyze app description texts, within a
larger mechanism to determine when two apps are similar; this
was used to inform developers when they may be requesting an
unnecessary permission. None of these privacy-oriented studies
applied NLP to analyze the text in user reviews.
User reviews have been analyzed using NLP, but not in the con-
text of privacy. Pagano and Maalej [
54
 
] conducted an empirical
analysis of iOS app reviews and found that reviews are not easy to
automatically analyze given their unstructured forms. Some efforts
have built classifiers to identify informative app reviews [

reviews useful for app maintenance [
 
55
 
]; others identified incon-
sistencies between user reviews and ratings, as well as performed
topic analysis of negative reviews to shed light on why users dislike
a given app [
 
26
 
] and unsupervised topic discovery composed of
semantically similar user comments based on bidirectional NLP
algorithms [
 
43
 
]; work has also been done to automatically match
bug reports with related app reviews [
 
44
 
]. In the Requirements
Engineering space there have been large bodies of work that fo-
cused on feature/requirements extraction from user reviews and/or
applied a sentiment analysis to find out how users like a certain
feature [
 
30
,
 
45
 
,
 
68
 
]. [
 
29
 
] developed a review summarization frame-
work to categorize app reviews into categories (e.g., bug reports
and feature requests), and also extracts aspects and their sentiments
(e.g., interface is good/poor). Tian et.al. have shown that including
crowd sourced review information in app update notifications was
more effective at alerting users of invasive or malicious app updates,
especially for less trustworthy apps [72].
The prior research that is closest to ours is [
 
8
,
 
51
 
,
 
52
 
]. Besmer
et al. [
8
 
] have trained a logistic regression model to detect privacy
app reviews, and have shown that privacy reviews have lower star
ratings and more negative sentiment, but have higher engagement
(more upvotes/downvotes). In both [
 
51
 
,
 
52
], the authors developed
a SVM classifier to extract reviews from the Play Store on the two
topics of security and privacy. The key purpose of [
 
52
 
] was to
determine if app reviews discussing security and privacy lead to
changes in the app, and [
51
 
] focused on how actual app behavior
influences users‚Äô security and privacy concerns. Using static code
analysis, the authors in [
52
 
] were able to demonstrate that the
presence of security and privacy reviews are predictive of security
and privacy app updates in 60% of the cases they looked at. This
is very encouraging, as it means developers do respond to issues
raised in these types of reviews. As part of that work, the authors
had to develop a security and privacy review classifier to extract
those reviews. The authors in [
51
 
] use dynamic analysis to show
users security and privacy concerns are justified in that the apps
do often exhibit troublesome behavior along the lines indicated in
reviews.
Our work differs from these efforts in several ways. First, our
focus is on privacy, not security and privacy combined. (We ac-
knowledge that security and privacy are interwoven, at times, es-
pecially when security issues such as account hacking or password
management have privacy consequences). Second, their classifiers
rely on a basic SVM/Logistic Regression models and follow a bag-
of-words approach. We use state of the art deep learning based NLP
models (e.g., USE and BERT) that offer multiple advantages. These
transformer models are trained on large corpuses of text (e.g., BERT
is trained on Wikipedia) and thus these models have the potential to
generalize beyond the labeled examples. As explained more fully in
Section 3.2.1, a bag-of-words approach is likely to miss context, and
that matters for identifying privacy-related reviews across a broad
set of privacy topics. Third, we work with a larger dataset. We man-
ually labeled 11K examples (compared to 2.4K in [
8
], 4K in [
 
52
 
] and
6K in [
51
 
]). We ran our inference analysis on 287M reviews. Fourth,
our method incorporates clustering and summarization whereas
these prior efforts only included classification. This is needed since
our end goal - to provide a way to report users perspectives at scale
- is different.
There is an enormous body of usable security research on user
perceptions towards mobile app privacy. Most quantitative work
have found that people are very protective of their personal in-
formation when using apps [
 
36
 
,
 
77
], and actively engage with of-
fered privacy controls to safeguard their information [
 
10
 
,
 
39
 
,
 
73
 
].
User frustration due to apps requesting unnecessary permissions
has been well studied [
23
,
 
38
,
 
39
 
,
 
64
 
,
 
73
 
,
 
75
 
]. In fact, users were
often surprised by the abilities of applications to collect data in
the background [
35
,
 
71
 
], and were concerned with possible risks
associated with permissions [
24
 
]. Special attention has been on
studying the privacy concerns arising due to users‚Äô location being
tracked [3, 17, 22].
These prior studies reveal similar privacy concerns that we ob-
serve in our research. However, they are all done by surveying few
hundred participants or interviewing 30 or less participants. Our
methodology scales up to large numbers of user reviews and tracks
these issues efficiently across all apps, and our findings show the
prevalence of specific privacy concerns across app categories.

METHODOLOGY

Figure 1 illustrates an overview of our approach. On the left are
examples of reviews, some of which are about privacy and one of
which is not (marked in yellow). Our first task is to extract those
reviews that are related to privacy. This is achieved by constructing
a binary classifier to distinguish between the privacy and non-
privacy reviews. In figure 1, the review about taking pictures has
been filtered out in the sample list of ‚Äúprivacy reviews‚Äù. Our second
task is to identify the common fine-grained privacy themes within
the privacy-relevant app reviews. For this we leverage K-Means
clustering;
 
‚Äòk‚Äô
 
is a parameter that needs to be chosen upfront, and we
propose a custom metric to choose the best value for
 
‚Äòk‚Äô
. We use the
TensorFlow [
1
] machine learning tool for training a binary classifier
and clustering the privacy-related app reviews. In the following
sections, we describe how we generate test, validation and training
data; present the design of our privacy classifier; and describe our
method for clustering and summarizing privacy-related reviews.

3.1
 
Dataset Curation

In order to develop test, validation, training and inference datasets,
we collected approximately 580M Play reviews in English published
on the Play store between April 2014 and Feb 2020. Our dataset was
anonymized in terms of app names, as each review was only labeled
by its app category; however we were given an aggregated app
count of 2M. We started with zero labeled data. As per the many
methods for generating labeled data, as outlined well in [
61
 
], we
use Expert-Hand-Labeling (by subject matter experts) for our test
and validation datasets to ensure these are of the highest quality
since they are used to evaluate the performance of our machine
learning models. Prior work [
 
52
] hints that privacy related reviews
may constitute less than 1% of all reviews, hence we were facing
an extremely imbalanced dataset. To bootstrap this procedure and
generate candidate reviews that are likely to be about privacy we did
the following. We relied on two well known privacy taxonomies [
4
,
67
 
] to set the framing for our initial definition and scope of privacy
issues. We curated an initial seed list of n-grams inspired by these
taxonomies. Our manual labeling team consisted of the authors

and three linguists. We filtered reviews based on this initial seed
and conducted a preliminary manual evaluation. We looked to see
the types of words and expressions that users employ to express
privacy concerns.
There were two observations in this bootstrapping phase. First,
filtering using 1-gram and 2-gram words can result in many false
positives; for example, the single word ‚Äútrust‚Äù can be used in ‚Äúdon‚Äôt
trust your teammates‚Äù, which is not a statement about privacy.
Thus, we decided to only use n-grams with
 
ùëõ
 
>
=
 
3
 
for further
filtering. Second, we converted our seed list of n-grams to regular
expressions and expanded the set of expressions based on this
manual exploration. Regex patterns allow us to succinctly capture
grammatical variants of typical privacy statements. For every regex
pattern, we checked to see if it occurred in at least 100 reviews
that were privacy-related. Our regexes captured approximately 200
n-grams. We acknowledge that our list may not be complete and
might have missed privacy issues or phrases used to discuss privacy.
We next selected
 
‚àº
11K app reviews for manual labeling. To
ensure we ended up with enough labeled privacy examples, we
selected 60% of the 11K reviews because they matched against our
regex patterns, and the other 40% were ensured to not match any of
the regexes. Each of the 11K reviews were manually examined and
cross-labeled by three raters and a label (privacy or not privacy) was
assigned. For the vast majority of reviews, all three labelers agreed.
When this was not the case, discussion ensued until an agreement
was reached. Among the 11,371 manually labeled reviews (ground
truth),
 
6688
 
were labeled as
 
privacy
 
and
 
4683
 
were
 
not privacy
.
The validation dataset used to evaluate the performance of the ML
models after each training epoch was created by extracting
 
250
privacy
 
and
 
250 not privacy
 
reviews from this set. The remain-
ing 10,871 reviews were treated as the test set for comparing the
performance of different privacy classifiers.
Because each of our regexes (capturing 200+ n-grams) was veri-
fied ‚Äì by checking for its appearance in at least 100 privacy-related
reviews, and also based on our manual labeling exercise ‚Äì we as-
sume our regex list effectively constitutes a set of good quality
heuristics. We use these to generate our training data, as per the
method of
 
Heuristic-Supervision
 
as in [
 
61
 
]. We used roughly half
of the reviews (
‚àº
290M) to generate training samples. From this set
we identified 250K app reviews that matched our privacy regex
patterns and labeled them as privacy-related reviews; we then ran-
domly sampled another 250K reviews that did not contain any of
our privacy regexes and labeled them as not-privacy. Our privacy
regex patterns could only identify 0.08% of reviews as being related
to privacy. Finally, we used the second half of our collected reviews,
namely 287M reviews, as our inference dataset. We performed clas-
sification, clustering and summarization on this set to understand
users‚Äô top privacy concerns. The sizes of our training, validation
and test datasets are shows in Table 1.

Ethical Considerations:
 
Our institution approved the use of
this dataset because Play reviews are already public. In compliance
with ethical training guidelines in our institution, we ensured that
users‚Äô privacy were respected. We thus carried out the following.
First, all researchers have been trained in ethical user research prior
to this study. Second, the dataset was preprocessed to remove user
identifiers and app names before the researchers were given access.
The only accompanying metadata beyond the review text, was the
app‚Äôs category name and the publish timestamp. Third, access to
this version of the dataset is limited to the authors of this paper.

3.2
 
Privacy Classifier

The simplest approach to extract privacy related reviews might be
via a keyword list. However, it is non-trivial for multiple reasons
to curate a comprehensive list of keywords. In addition to the
false positive issue discussed in Section 3.1, the same word could
mean different things depending on the context. For example, the
occurrence of ‚Äúinvading‚Äù in a war game app review likely does not
refer to a privacy concern, whereas it might in a review about a
parental control app with a location tracking feature (e.g. ‚Äúthis app
is invading my privacy‚Äù). Moreover, there could also be instances
where a review does not contain privacy keywords but, based on
its context, still be related to privacy. For instance, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want my
friend accessing my email‚Äù does not contain any privacy specific
keywords but is a privacy concern based on the context.
Traditional approaches to analyze text rely on the bag-of-words [
33
]
representation or use word embeddings, such as Word2Vec [
50
 
]
and GloVe [
 
58
], to encode text. Such systems do not encode infor-
mation about the word sequence, and therefore cannot differentiate
between reviews containing the same words in different order. For
example, ‚Äúdelete cookies and website history‚Äù and ‚Äúmy article on
history of cookies got deleted from website‚Äù use same words but

have different meanings. In addition to handling context, and word
sequence, we also need to be able to correctly process reviews that
are frequently unstructured, contain highly variable writing styles,
grammatical errors and misspellings.
The above limitations establish the need to process reviews by in-
corporating robust NL Understanding components. In this work, we
use state-of-the-art pre-trained natural language models, BERT [
20
 
]
and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) [
 
14
 
], to efficiently encode
user reviews into an abstract representation. These models are bet-
ter known to capture contexts. We provide here a brief background
on the BERT and USE language models.

(BERT) [
20
 
] is a language representation model based on the Trans-
former architecture that has been trained on 3.3 billion word corpus.
The model was trained on two tasks: ‚Äúmasked language modelling‚Äù,
where the aim is to predict the masked-out words of the input text
using the information present in the surrounding words, and ‚Äúnext
sentence prediction‚Äù, where the model predicts the next sentence
given the first sentence as the input. The large pre-trained BERT
neural network model has had great success in NLU tasks, such as
text summarization [
41
 
], question-answering [
42
 
], and has been
shown to deliver impressive performance on downstream tasks
even when working with small training datasets [
 
69
 
]. Hence, we
fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on our training set to create
a binary privacy classifier.

ncoder is another deep neural net-

]) to learn meaningful sentence
representations [
14
]. The model is trained on data from various
sources, such as Wikipedia, discussion forums, web questions and
answers, etc.; and has shown great performance in detecting fake
news spreaders on Twitter [
46
 
] and in learning cross-lingual text
representations [
16
 
]. Unlike BERT, we do not fine-tune the USE
model, instead use the readily available pre-trained USE TF-Hub
module
 
2
 
(which provides text embedding representations directly)
and build a two-layer feed-forward neural network on top for cre-
ating our privacy classifier.

3.2.1
 
Models.
 
We propose the following four model variants as
candidates for our privacy classifier.

(Vanilla) BERT
: We take the pre-trained BERT model, and add
one additional network layer after the last layer for binary classifi-
cation. We use a [CLS] token (start-of-sentence) to represent each
review in its entirety. Thus our additional layer simply transforms
the embeddings learnt for the [CLS] token to the two classes, i.e.,
privacy and not privacy. We fine-tune the BERT model on our train-
ing data for three epochs, and choose the best epoch model based
on the performance on the validation dataset.

Sentiment-aware BERT (BERT-SST)
: From a preliminary anal-
ysis, we found that the privacy review texts generally have a neg-
ative sentiment. We use this information to further strengthen
our BERT-based privacy classifier, by first fine-tuning BERT for
sentiment classification task. Using similar model architecture men-
tioned above for (Vanilla) BERT, we first train the model on a text-
sentiment dataset: Stanford Sentiment Treebank
3
, that contains

https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/

text and its binary (positive or negative) sentiment label. We then
fine-tune this model on our training data to create the privacy
classifier. We simply map the privacy class to the negative senti-
ment class, and not-privacy to the positive one. We fine-tune the
sentiment-aware BERT model for three epochs and choose the best
epoch model based on the performance on the validation set.

USE
: We extract a new
 
512
-dimensional embedding representa-
tion for each review by passing the reviews through the pre-trained
USE model that is based on Deep Averaging Network encoder. We
then pass the embedding through a feed-forward neural network
with
 
2
 
layers and
 
512
 
hidden units each. The output of the
 
2
ùëõùëë
 
layer
is then mapped to the two classes, i.e., privacy and not-privacy. The
model is trained with the objective to maximize the probability of
the correct class, and thus we use cross-entropy loss to optimize
the network. We train the model for 20 epochs and chose the best
model based on performance on the validation set.

Ensemble Model
: In our experimentation, we noticed inconsis-
tent label assignments by each of the three privacy classifiers above.
(This is understandable as the underlying BERT and USE models are
pre-trained on different datasets with distinct characteristics.) To
better understand the scenarios where USE and BERT models were
making different decisions (privacy or not-privacy), we manually
examined about 1000+ reviews that had different labels from the
two models. Below is an example of a statement that USE classified
as
 
privacy
 
whereas BERT labled it
 
not-privacy
.

‚Äúyou can record call automatically, record anonymous calls, record
important calls ... you can choose the phone numbers in the phone-
book or recording call automatic. the list of recorded files will be
stored and streamlined for you in the phone call recorder.‚Äù

The following is an example of a review that BERT predicted as
privacy whereas USE did not.

‚Äúnot having tamil channels and sports channels which is the way
of looting the trust from the customer service‚Äù

The first example is ambiguous as making anonymous phone
calls could be perceived as being related to privacy. However, this
review mainly lists app features. The second example mentions
trust however this isn‚Äôt a privacy issue but instead perhaps one of
feeling excluded due to a language not supported in the app. We
wouldn‚Äôt consider either of these to be about privacy.
To reduce such ambiguities and improve our confidence in the
privacy review identification, our Ensemble model considers a re-
view to be about privacy, if and only if, all three classifiers (USE,
BERT and BERT-SST) labeled it as privacy. Note that this makes
our model conservative (i.e., we will underestimate the number
of privacy reviews) since we are choosing to focus on precision
rather than recall. For our purposes of broadly understanding users‚Äô
privacy concerns with mobile apps, we prefer to have less noise in
our clusters. We acknowledge that a developer using such a method
may opt for high recall to be sure not to miss any particular issue.

3.2.2
 
Performance of Models.
 
We evaluate our four privacy classi-
fier models (see Table 2) on the test dataset. High recall numbers
indicate that the model is able to correctly identify most of the
privacy-related reviews, and a high precision indicates that the
model rarely labels a not-privacy review as being related to privacy.
From the table, we see that the USE model has a high recall and a

relatively low precision, meaning that it has more false positives
(not-privacy reviews labeled as privacy). On the other hand, both
the BERT based models have a higher precision but low recall com-
pared to USE. The BERT-SST model has higher accuracy than BERT,
but looking at the F1 scores, vanilla BERT model performed better
than BERT-SST. As expected the Ensemble model has the highest
precision; it also obtains the highest AUC value, and a good F1
score. We use thus the Ensemble model in the remainder of this
work for our classification task.
We did a qualitative analysis to see if our ensemble classifier was
able to generalize its learning beyond the terms and expressions in
our regex patterns. First we checked to see if our classifier learned
any concepts not included in our regex patterns. For example, we
did not include any terms related to ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù or ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù
in our regexes, however we did find a number of reviews that
mention ‚ÄúI like the anonymity ...‚Äù. Our model likely learned that the
words related to ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù are often associated with privacy
because of the following. The following real review -
 
‚Äúi don‚Äôt want
a personalized profile full of surveillance. anonymous access is a
preferred‚Äù
 
- could have been flagged as privacy because of the word
"surveillance" (that was in our regexes). Since this review also
contains the word "anonymous", the classifier learns to associate
this with the privacy label (given enough similar examples). Second,
we compared the fraction of privacy reviews that our regexes alone
match (0.08% in the 290M reviews used to generate our training data,
Section 3.1), with those extracted by our classifier, namely (0.15%
from our 287M reviews test data). This shows that our classifier
does generalize beyond the terms and expressions in the regexes as
it identifies roughly twice the amount of content as our regexes.

3.3
 
Clustering and Summarization

The next step in our pipeline is Clustering and Summarization of the
privacy related reviews to tease out the different privacy concerns
users describe. We know from prior work as well as our curated
set of n-grams, there are a multitude of things users might write
about, such as personal data collection, privacy controls, location
tracking, a feeling of being spied on, third party data sharing, new
privacy features, consents, etc. We refer to these as
 
privacy themes
.
Since app reviews do not have fine-grained labels for such privacy
themes, we use unsupervised learning (specifically clustering) to
identify the common privacy issues. We use K-means clustering as
our approach to clustering because it is simple and broadly used,
and leave exploration of other clustering solutions as future work.
We apply K-means to the set of privacy reviews per app category
(Games, Parenting, Tools, etc). The motivation for studying cat-
egories independently is that the number of reviews across app
categories was highly variable (ref Table 3). Analyzing all the re-
views together would have not highlighted users‚Äô concerns in app

categories with lower numbers of reviews. Analyzing the categories
independently helped us identify issues which may be prominent
in one category but not in others (e.g., tracking and selling data
was not a key concern in the Games category).
Once these clusters are determined, we summarize the topic
discussed in a cluster by selecting some highly representative re-
views for each cluster. After independently reviewing the top rep-
resentative reviews and labelling the clusters in each category, we
performed a second round of annotation where we cross-checked
the cluster labels across categories and mapped clusters discussing
the same concerns to the broader topic.

K-Means clustering
: We use the 512-dimensional USE embed-
ding generated for each review to perform clustering. We use em-
beddings derived from our USE-based model instead of BERT-based
models as it lead to a higher AUC score (refer Table 2). The clus-
tering is performed within an app category, and
 
Cosine Distance

is used as the distance metric. Like any other clustering task, the
challenge here is:
 
how to determine a good
 
ùëò
 
value
 
for the number of
target clusters, without knowing ahead of time how many distinct
themes users may be writing about. There exist various metrics in
the literature to choose
 
ùëò
, such as the Silhouette Score[
 
62
], Dunn
Index[
21
 
], CH-Score[
12
 
], etc. These metrics primarily reward well
separated and compact clusters, which is also our goal. However,
these metrics implicitly assume the following: 1) a sample belongs
to only one cluster (or only belongs to one privacy theme); and 2)
all samples belong to some cluster, i.e., no sample is considered to
be an exception or outlier. For privacy related Play reviews, these
assumptions do not always hold. Consider this example:

Analyzing User Perspectives on Mobile App Privacy at Scale
 
ICSE ‚Äô22, May 21‚Äì29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

‚Äú1 star for forcing people to create an account. no it‚Äôs not necessary
for the user. it‚Äôs apparently necessary for [APP_NAME_REDACTED].
permissions they demand aren‚Äôt necessary and invasive. this app
is more like spyware. clearly [APP_NAME_REDACTED] is making
money off of people‚Äôs personal and private information. i don‚Äôt
recommend this product. at minimum, if you‚Äôre going to use this
app, give them fake information. however they won‚Äôt even let you
use the app if you don‚Äôt give them location tracking information.
undoubtedly, they‚Äôll be another company in the news soon for
exploiting customer privacy.‚Äù

This example review touches on multiple privacy themes, including
unnecessary permissions, spyware, location tracking, and general
privacy exploitation. There is potential that each of these fine-
grained topics produce its own cluster when running K-Means; so
this example review would be hard to place within one cluster as it
might naturally be on the border of multiple clusters. Therefore, we
aim to limit the influence of such reviews on the cluster formation
by optimizing for the creation of well-formed clusters ‚Äì clusters
that predominantly discuss a single privacy issue. The next example
illustrates the second assumption:

‚Äúi wish it worked better for pregnancy milestones, bump pics, etc.
all the reminders assume your kid is born regardless of entering the
due date. also, the pictures take forever to load. i uploaded multiple
pics for one day and my sister thought it was just 1 pic because of
the slow load time. COMPANY_NAME_REDACTED is faster and i
can make a private group so my pics aren‚Äôt super public.‚Äù

In this example, the user seems to be primarily expressing dissatis-
faction about the reminder mechanisms and upload speeds. They
also mention that they would like a new privacy feature, namely
the ability to create private groups. The request for a private group
option does make this a legitimate review about privacy. However,
we did not find similar requests in other reviews in parenting apps,
and thus this review is an outlier. We aim to limit the influence of
such reviews in the clusters produced.
Given this, we have the following goals. Firstly, we aim for well
separated clusters. Secondly, we aim to have a high number of
clusters that have limited mixed-concern reviews and to minimize
the number of outliers. To achieve this, we propose a
 
summarization
metric
 
that will reward a value of
 
ùëò
 
based on these criteria.
To address this first goal we use the following construct. Let
 
ùëÜ
ùëñ

denote the center of cluster
 
ùëñ
. We define
 
ùëëùëñùë†ùë°
ùëò
 
as:

ùëëùëñùë†ùë°
ùëò
 
=

{

]
.
 
ùõø
 
(
ùëÜ
ùëñ
 
, ùëÜ
 
ùëó
 
)
 
is the cosine distance
between two cluster centers.
 
ùëëùëñùë†ùë°
ùëò
 
represents the minimum pairwise
distance among all pairs of
 
ùëò
 
cluster centers. Maximizing
 
ùëëùëñùë†ùë°
ùëò

ensures that the cluster centers be far apart in the vector space.
We iterate through multiple values of
 
ùëò
 
and select the one that
maximizes this metric. This formula varies compared to existing
metrics, where an average of inter-cluster distance is generally
taken into account. Here we ensure that the minimum inter-cluster
distance is the highest for the chosen
 
ùëò
 
value.
To address our goals of limiting the influence of mixed-concern
reviews and outliers, we want intuitively to ‚Äúignore‚Äù reviews that
are
 
loosely associated
 
with a cluster, as well as the mixed-concern
reviews as these are likely to be ‚Äúborderline‚Äù between multiple

Figure 2: Silhouette Scores using K-Means for k=5

clusters. We aim to count the reviews within a cluster that are
closely related, and refer to them as
 
upvotes
 
(defined below). We
use the
 
silhouette score
 
to do this. Recall that the silhouette score

ùë†
 
(
ùëñ
)
 
formulates how close each point is to its cluster center and how
far it is from the nearest neighboring cluster, namely

ùë†

max
(
ùëè
 
(
ùëñ
)
, ùëé
(
ùëñ
))

where
 
ùëè
 
(
ùëñ
)
 
is the lowest average distance between
 
ùëñ
-th point and
any cluster of which it is not a member, and
 
ùëé
(
ùëñ
)
 
is the average
distance between
 
ùëñ
 
and all the other points of the same cluster. As
an example, we run K-Means with
 
ùëò
 
=
 
5
 
on reviews identified as
privacy in the
 
Parenting
 
category and compute the silhouette scores
for each review, as shown in Figure 2. A negative silhouette score
indicates that the review is assigned to a wrong cluster, as it is
closer to the neighboring cluster. The dotted red line in Figure 2
represents the average silhouette score across all the reviews in the
category. A low silhouette score (close to zero) indicates that the
review is very close to the cluster boundary (data points/reviews
which are on LHS of the red line, but still positive), and a high
silhouette score indicates the review is closer to its own cluster
center (data points/reviews on the RHS of the red line). We refer to
reviews with silhouette score higher than the average silhouette
score as
 
upvotes
 
for a given theme in a cluster. From Figure 2 we
see that it could be useful to retain clusters 0, 1, and 4 that have
a larger amount of upvotes and ignore clusters 2 and 3. Clusters
2 and 3 are likely to be poor quality since most of the silhouette
scores are negative or below the average silhouette score. Hence
in this illustrative example, we would aim to have 3 final clusters
and simply not capture the ignored clusters which are unlikely to
contribute to top issues.
We consider clusters to be compact when they have a high num-
ber of upvotes, and a low number of mixed-concern reviews in a
given cluster. Therefore, we can rephrase our goal as aiming for a

k
 
that results in high number of
 
compact
 
clusters where a compact
cluster is defined as one in which at least 30% of the samples are

upvotes. We refer to the number of compact clusters identified as

ùëÄ
ùëò
 
, for a given
 
k
.
We combine the above two principles, and define a new
 
Sum-
marization Metric
 
as follows:

Summarization Metric
 
=
 
(
ùëëùëñùë†ùë°
ùëò
 
‚àó
 
ùëÄ
ùëò
 
)
 
(2)
We iterate through
 
ùëò
 
=
 
2
, ...,
 
10
 
and chose
 
ùëò
 
for which the summa-
rization score is highest, as we want to increase both
 
ùëëùëñùë†ùë°
ùëò
 
(distance
between cluster centers) and
 
ùëÄ
ùëò
 
(number of compact clusters). We
use
 
ùëÄ
ùëê
 
to denote the final number of compact clusters identified for
the chosen
 
ùëò
. We consider
 
ùëò
 
between 2 and 10 because in our initial
exploration using our methodology, we focus on dominant privacy
concerns. However using a larger
 
ùëò
 
would enable an analyst to look
through the long-tail of privacy concerns.
We may end up with tens of thousands of reviews in a single
cluster, thus it is important to summarize them in a way that cap-
tures the primary concern. We do this by selecting a few specific
reviews that can be considered as representative of the reviews in
the entire cluster. By summarizing this way, we capture the cluster
topic
 
in the users‚Äô own words
. We rank reviews within a cluster
according to their silhouette scores and use the top ten reviews
with the highest scores as the representative reviews. We carefully
analyzed these cluster representatives manually across all clusters
and verified that these reviews indeed illustrate the main topic in
each cluster. In the next sections, we select quotes/reviews that
came from different categories to show the breadth of the issues
across app categories.

3.4
 
Limitations

We used K-means as our first approach to clustering because it is
simple and broadly used. However, our clusters are quite uneven
in size, and thus more sophisticated approaches (such as Affinity
Clustering [7]) could yield improved performance.
This kind of work is inherently hard because the definition of
privacy is not exact. We relied on previously accepted privacy
taxonomies, three professional linguists, and our own experience
reading huge numbers of privacy reviews. A clearer sense of the
distinction (or accepted overlaps) between security, censorship, ha-
rassment and privacy could take the form of agreed upon guidelines
by a community of domain experts.
Although user perspectives within a cluster are automatically
summarized by the representative sentences (ranked by silhouette
scores), there is still a manual step in assigning thematic labels to
each cluster (i.e privacy controls, selling data, etc.) - that we did
by reading the top 20 reviews per cluster and finding a label based
upon our interpretation of those reviews. NLP methods for topic
labeling [48, 78] could automate this step - although their efficacy
in the privacy domain needs to be evaluated.

PRIVACY THEMES

In this section, we present the top privacy themes that are associated
with different app categories. To do this, we run our clustering
analysis on the previously extracted privacy reviews. Due to space
limitations, we present findings from 10 Play Store app categories
instead of all 29 categories. We selected categories that were either
large or ones where we expected privacy concerns might arise.
Recall that our clustering iterates through
 
ùëò
=2...10 and picks the
best
 
ùëò
 
(number of clusters) according to our summarization metric.
For each of our 10 app categories, we found that
 
ùëò
 
varied from 6 to
9. We looked at the compact clusters across these 10 categories, and
identified 5 themes that were dominant across multiple categories.
Within each cluster considered, we ranked the reviews in those
clusters by silhouette score. Recall that the top ranked reviews
essentially represent the topic of the cluster as they are central to
the cluster. For each of our selected clusters, we manually read the
top 20 most representative reviews, and assigned a short thematic
label to the cluster for ease of presentation and for summarization.
For example, we assigned the thematic label
 
too many permis-
sions
 
to clusters whose representative reviews frequently mention
that an app requests more permissions than what seems needed.
These reviews are referring to the Android permissions such as
location, contacts, microphone, camera, etc. This theme was present
across all app categories, with location permission being the highest
occurring sub-theme. In other large clusters, many reviews com-
ment on the collection of
 
personal information
. Such reviews
typically refer to information such as address, email, profile info, etc.
Other themes we identified include
 
privacy controls, tracking

and
 
selling data
. The cluster of reviews assigned the
 
privacy-
controls
 
theme captures reviews that either discuss the existing
privacy controls of an app, or ask for a new privacy feature to be
added to the app. Table 4 shows our themes and app categories;
there is an asterisk in each table entry if that theme appears as the
top-5 issue for the respective app category. A blank cell means that
this topic did not surface as one of our
 
ùëÄ
ùëê
 
compact clusters for a
given app category (there might still be reviews on this topic, but
they are not large enough to generate a compact cluster).
While these privacy themes have been identified in qualitative
studies before [
 
3
,
 
25
 
,
 
36
,
 
47
 
,
 
79
],
 
our analysis is the first large
scale work to confirm these findings empirically
. Moreover,
we are able to quantify the volume per theme thereby enabling us
to rank these issues, and we are able to show which issues occur
across multiple app categories (e.g. permissions) and which occur
in only a few categories (e.g. selling data).
Given the scope of each of the themes, our purpose here is not to
dive into details individually, but instead to summarize succinctly
how users express these pain points. The included examples below
come from our top ten representative reviews per cluster (topic), per
app category. Because these examples are central to clusters of many
thousands of similar reviews, they summarize the views of large
groups of users. Our clusters ranged from a few thousand up to 20K
in size. Among these representative reviews, we selected examples
from different categories to illustrate that privacy concerns are
rarely category specific. A more detailed look into each specific
privacy theme is left as future work.

4.1
 
Concern 1: Too Many Permissions

The largest cluster, in each of our 10 categories, contains reviews
that make comments about the app asking for too many permis-
sions. This is expected as permissions are the gateway to accessing
personal information, and prior work has pointed to excessive per-
missions being a major concern [

no business for (in this case, access to my contacts), no thanks‚Äù

(Auto & Vehicles)
The first two reviews focus on whether the data collected is really
needed for the functionality of the app. In example 1, the disconnect
between the permissions asked for and the user‚Äôs perception of the
app functionality caused this user to uninstall the app, and switch
to a more privacy-friendly app. In example 2, the user is asking for
the purpose of collecting contacts (presumably because it is not
clear from the context). The importance of sharing purpose with
users has been established in the academic literature [
 
6
 
,
 
36
 
,
 
73
 
], and
even in Android‚Äôs best practice guidelines
4
; it is interesting to now
see users effectively demanding that. It is important for developers
to learn when users have such concerns, as they can be mitigated
by providing explanations [
 
40
,
 
70
 
] to address the ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù type
questions. In example 3, users state they feel that data collection
from some permission requests is ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù or a ‚Äúrisk‚Äù.

Figure 3: Privacy reviews that discuss permissions

We also examined which reviews mention a specific permission,
such as microphone, location, etc. To do this we used simple key-
word matching such as
 
phone, call log, contact, microphone, location,

sms
, and checked if the word
 
permission
 
appeared somewhere in the
review. Figure 3 shows the number of privacy reviews that mention
each permission group as well as the percentage of reviews they
represent. We see that the location permission is the most discussed
permission, appearing in over 40,000 reviews (13% of the privacy
reviews). Contacts is the second most discussed permission.

4.2
 
Concern 2: Too Much Personal Information

Reviews in which users complain that too much personally identi-
fiable information (PII) is being collected is the second dominant
privacy concern, and occurred in eight of our ten categories exam-
ined herein. While prior work has shown that users are concerned
about too much personal information being collected, both in the
context of mobile apps [
36
 
,
 
77
 
] and generally [
 
2
,
 
11
 
], unlike ours
they do not rely on experiences users have using their own devices
in the wild. Our analysis additionally shows that users warn oth-
ers not to download an app explicitly because of PII collection, as
shown in the following two examples:
(1)
 
‚Äúwhen it won‚Äôt let you play the game unless you agree to let
it use your information , it ain‚Äôt worth playing . if you want
privacy , don‚Äôt download it‚Äù
 
(Games)
(2)
 
‚Äúdont do this!!! youre only giving the app your personal info!
what you look like, your finger prints, everything! i downloaded
this app just to warn everyone not to give this app permission to
anything on your device! ... this is dangerous!‚Äù
 
(Entertainment)
Other users indicate their suspicion i.e., there is no good reason
for the data collection. These suspicions, which are in essence
requests for data collection justification, reflects the same issue we
saw in the reviews about
 
too-many-permissions
 
‚Äì applied to
different data items. In the first two examples below, the users are
clearly quite annoyed. The user in the 3rd example implies that
they might have uninstalled the app because of this reason.
(1)
 
‚Äúwhy the hell you need access to everything, you are service
provider or intruder in privacy.‚Äù
 
(Auto & Vehicles)
(2)
 
‚Äúhorrific registration process; requiring personal information
irrelevant to the application‚Äôs purpose.‚Äù
 
(Maps and Navigation)
(3)
 
‚Äúwhy does it need my device ids and the phone numbers of my
callers. who i communicate with is none of their business. this
app appears to be collecting more info than it requires to offer
it‚Äôs services ... they have no respect for my privacy, the app was
useful.‚Äù
 
(Health and Fitness)
Yet other users express themselves with terms relating to theft
or harassment, as the following two examples convey. Clearly trust
is impacted if users interpret an app‚Äôs behavior this way.

Other Dominant Privacy Concerns

Privacy Controls.
 
Comments about privacy controls were a com-
mon issue across 5 app categories, namely in Communication, Par-
enting, Photography, Tools and Games. The fraction of reviews
discussing this theme ranged from 24% for Communication apps
to 6% for Games. The reviews about privacy controls show an in-
teresting breadth, from explicitly requesting privacy controls to be
easier (example 1), to frustration with privacy controls (example
2), to requesting new features (e.g. private chat in example 3). In
example 2, the user is trying to hide some photos within app, yet
does not appear to be able to do so successfully. To address the user
frustration with using the offered privacy controls, personalized
privacy assistants have been proposed [39, 73].
(1)
 
‚Äúdon‚Äôt share my pics on public domain without my permission,
when people search for specific location to visit pics appear, so
make privacy settings easy.‚Äù
 
(Photography)
(2)
 
‚Äúlock the pics you dont wanna see then they just get copied
right back to the gallery doesnt hide anything.‚Äù
 
(Tools)
(3)
 
‚Äúi love this game ! it is so addictive and fun ! ... the only thing i
would want to change add is private chat.‚Äù
 
(Games)

Tracking.
 
We saw tracking as a dominant concern in 5 app cate-
gories, namely Communications, Entertainment, Parenting, Pho-
tography and Medical apps. The fraction of privacy reviews that
discuss tracking ranged from a minimum of 10% in Entertainment
apps up to 38% in Parenting apps. Privacy concerns arising due
to users‚Äô location being tracked have been well studied [
3
,
 
17
 
,
 
22
 
],
but our analysis shows that location isn‚Äôt the only attribute people
are concerned about being tracked. Purchase history, contacts, and
other personal information are also important. As the examples
below show, users sentiment on this topic can range from annoyed
to angry. Since our methods can extract reviews on this issue, it
permits future work on sentiment analysis and perhaps a deeper
exploration into which types of data are more sensitive. (Note, the
third example mentions private information as well as spying and
thus provides an example of reviews that fall on the boundary of
two themes (one of the challenges in Section 3.3)).
(1)
 
‚Äúwarning: this app is spyware and will track all your location
info and purchases.‚Äù
 
(Entertainment)
(2)
 
‚Äúspyware, data miner. will not connect until you grant access
to your phone location and data. contacts and location are
personal information. cameras don‚Äôt need this to function. you
lie to public!‚Äù
 
(Photography)
(3)
 
‚Äúi agree with protecting your child. but when your a teen like
me you feel like you cant breath without constantly being
watched. it‚Äôs like being stalked by your own family, and as if
you can‚Äôt trust them. there‚Äôs a boundary between protection
and privacy. and this is stepping over the line.‚Äù
 
(Parenting).

Selling Data.
 
Users‚Äô have previously expressed concerns with ser-
vice providers selling their data [
 
18
,
 
76
 
]. We show here that upset
due to the perception of personal data being ‚Äúsold‚Äù to third parties
also appears in mobile apps. Unexpectedly though, we found this
to be dominant in only 3 app categories - that of Communications,
Medical and Entertainment apps. In the Communications apps, we
observed approximately 20% of the privacy reviews mentioning
selling user data, making this a significant privacy issue for Com-
munication apps. The examples below hint that this issue appears
to make users feel undermined, as the comments are quite cynical.
We also see that users imagine their data being sold off to a variety
of recipients, including to companies, the NSA, and spammers.
(1)
 
‚Äúi would highly recommend staying away from this cash grab
of an app and move to an app that actually cares about the data
it collects about you. i feel like this company, and application
are only used to track your data and information and selling
it off to the highest bidder, sad thing is, they make you pay for
it, so you‚Äôre essentially paying to get your information stolen.‚Äù

(Medical)
(2)
 
‚Äúthey are selling patient‚Äôs personal data to corporates. once u
use [COMPANY-NAME-REDACTED], u will start getting mails
and call from labs for medical tests. beware.‚Äù
 
(Medical)
(3)
 
‚Äúwhat i do not understand is why [COMPANY-NAME-REDACTED]
had to make another way that they could sell our private in-
formation to third parties like the NSA.‚Äù
 
(Communications)

Privacy Positive Reviews.
 
During the above exercise processing
the top privacy pain points, we found - to our surprise - that while
most privacy reviews are negative, we do see some privacy pos-
itive reviews. In these reviews, users mention that they like the
privacy controls (examples 1 and 2) or that they are grateful the app
is not collecting unnecessary information (example 3). The very
presence of such reviews indicates that developers can be rewarded
by privacy-friendly design. Examples include:
(1)
 
‚Äúthis is one of the best photo sharing apps out there. no need
to share your children‚Äôs whole lives on social media and mess
around with tons of privacy settings. you invite who you want
to your album and can share privately with your partner or
the whole family.‚Äù
 
(Parenting)
(2)
 
‚Äúgood way of keeping photos private.‚Äù
 
(Photography)
(3)
 
‚Äúit was great fun playing this. i like that they don‚Äôt want access
to your private information unlike other apps.‚Äù
 
(Games)
While these five themes were dominant concerns, there were
smaller review clusters that touched upon other topics, such as
‚Äúads related to personal information‚Äù and ‚Äúsafety concerns due to
personal information leakage‚Äù. The diversity of privacy issues is
broad thus making it challenging to provide examples of all topics,
due to lack of space.
Overall we found many of these reviews to be fairly privacy
savvy - many questioned the purpose of data collected and de-
manded justification, while others suggested specific privacy con-
trols they would like to see added. Our quotes from representative
reviews show that it is not uncommon for users to warn other
others to stay away from an app for privacy related reasons. The
dominant issue users are concerned about is the collection of too
much personal data, be it from app permissions or PII. We found
this to be true across nearly all app categories. We found reviews
of users who uninstall apps due to privacy related reasons; this

page No: 11 
===============
Analyzing User Perspectives on Mobile App Privacy at Scale
 
ICSE ‚Äô22, May 21‚Äì29, 2022, Pittsburgh, PA, USA

is important to know as we suspect that developers are not com-
pletely aware when this happens. We also found privacy positive
reviews and this indicates that developers can be publicly rewarded
for privacy friendly behavior.

5
 
IMPLICATIONS

We illustrate how our method enables developers to improve the
privacy of their products, and how app stores can leverage our
findings to design better privacy tools and best practices.

Organizing and understanding user feedback for a particular
app in a much more meaningful and actionable way.
 
Today,
the Play Developer Console [
 
27
 
] surfaces all privacy related user
reviews under a theme called ‚ÄúPrivacy‚Äù. This makes it difficult
to effectively understand user feedback and identify specific pain
points. Instead, embedding our methodology into such developer
feedback channels would allow app authors to address nuanced
privacy concerns directly. For instance, concerns on:

‚Ä¢
 
Too many permissions
: if a developer sees many users com-
plaining that they do not see the purpose for a permission
request, then a guideline would suggest to provide a mean-
ingful explanation or to remove the permission entirely.

‚Ä¢
 
Selling Data
: if a set of reviews shows much concern about
selling personal data and the app does not engage in such
behavior, then a developer would be advised to provide an
educational intervention to clarify this misunderstanding.

‚Ä¢
 
Privacy controls
: if reviews identify missing features or ca-
pabilities then these can be translated into product require-
ments or bug fixes [43, 44].

Guiding the design of new tools for developers to provide
transparency on their data-collection practices
, such as the
Apple Privacy Nutrition Labels [
5
], and its upcoming equivalent
in the Play Store [
59
]. Understanding user concerns at scale and
in depth via our methodology could inform the design of such
transparency initiatives.

‚Ä¢
 
Analyzing user concerns about
 
tracking, selling data, and too
much personal information
 
could shed light on what type
of labels are useful and how they should be designed. The
two label systems above are a good step forward as they en-
courage developers to be upfront about their collection and
sharing practices. Such labels could increase user trust and
help them differentiate between the privacy stance of com-
peting apps. Although proper use of such labels is turning
out to be challenging [37].

‚Ä¢
 
In the long term, our methodology will enable refining such
labels and tailor them to the specific concerns of users. It
will also allow monitoring of emerging privacy concerns.

Mechanism for providing insight into users perceptions of
privacy
. Beyond looking at top issues, one could evaluate how
privacy issues vary by country, by language, by time, or compare
privacy issues between children‚Äôs apps versus regular apps. Run-
ning sentiment analysis on such privacy text data sets, using tools
such as Stanford‚Äôs NLTK [
 
9
], would enable large-scale comparison
of sentiment across privacy issues and help developers and app
stores prioritize what to fix first. These insights would be very
valuable, especially for small scale apps that do not have resources
to analyse their reviews another way.

Nudging developers towards better privacy practices
. For in-
stance, today the Play Developer Console nudges developers to re-
move permissions that are not used by apps in its peer groups [
 
57
].
By using our methodology, these nudges can be expanded to the
other privacy concerns identified in this paper. For example, to mit-
igate tracking concerns, developers could be informed of malicious
ad libraries as opposed to those that are much more privacy safe.

6
 
CONCLUSION

Understanding privacy trends is key to address systemic concerns
across ecosystems and populations. To date, large-scale evidence
of where the main privacy concerns lie for app users has been lack-
ing. This paper is the first to provide a methodology that enables
automated analysis and succinct summarization of privacy feed-
back, on a large scale. Our methodology can act as a mechanism for
key ecosystem stakeholders to be responsive to evolving societal
concerns regarding privacy. As new technologies come to the fore
and as the risks of large-scale data harvesting become more appar-
ent, this is a stepping stone towards systematic understanding of
privacy concerns at scale.

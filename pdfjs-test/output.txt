First Section

A Subsection Sample

Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is not indented.
The first paragraph that follows a table, figure, equation etc. does not need an
indent, either.
Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

Sample Heading (Third Level)
 
Only two levels of headings should be num-
bered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered; they are formatted as run-in
headings.

Sample Heading (Fourth Level)
 
The contribution should contain no more than
four levels of headings. Table 1 gives a summary of all heading levels.

Table 1.
 
Table captions should be placed above the tables.

A figure caption is always placed below the illustration. Please note that short
captions are centered, while long ones are justified by the macro package automatically.

Theorem 1.
 
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas, propositions, and corol-
laries are styled the same way.
Proof.
 
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics, while the
following text appears in normal font.
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets and consecutive
numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year convention are also accept-
able. The following bibliography provides a sample reference list with entries
for journal articles [1], an LNCS chapter [2], a book [3], proceedings without
editors [4], and a homepage [5]. Multiple citations are grouped [1–3], [1, 3–5].

    "Real-world software development involves large sourcecode repositories",
    "Reading and trying to understand otherpeople’s code in such repositories is a difficult and unpleas-ant process for many software developers, especially whenthe code is not sufficiently commented",
    "For example, if theJava method in Fig",
    "1 does not have the comment in the be-ginning, it will take the programmer quite some efforts tograsp the meaning of the code",
    "However, with a meaning-ful sentence such as “calculates dot product of two points”as a descriptive comment, programmer’s productivity can betremendously improved",

    "On average, only 15",
    "4% of the methodsare commented",
    "To automatically generate descriptive comments fromsource code, one needs a way of accurately representing thesemantics of code blocks",
    "One potential solution is to treateach code block as a document and represent it by a topicdistribution using models such as LDA (Blei, Ng, and Jor-dan 2003)",
